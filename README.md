## What do you mean by 'Ultrasimplified'?

### 1. Real World Demos ðŸš€

You won't find basic hello world demos here. The demos have been intentionally designed to be actually helpful and **relatable**.

### 2. Mimics your day-to-day job as a developer ðŸ–¥

Each pattern is implemented and discussed via **a pull request**. **View** the PRs. **Read** the descriptions. Read the **comments**. Like you do at work!

## Coming from my [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-guide-to-advanced-react-patterns/)?

- The branch we start off from is branch `clean-slate`. [See branch](https://github.com/ohansemmanuel/advanced-react-patterns-ultrasimplified/tree/clean-slate)
- Every lesson starts off in a new "clean-slate" branch e.g. "clean-slate-01", "clean-slate-02", "clean-slate-03" etc.

* The development DEMO site lives here: https://dev-advanced-react-patterns-ultrasimplified.netlify.com/

## But I'm just a beginner. Isn't this too advanced?

Ideally, **you're not new to React**. This is targetted more towards intermediate React engineers, but I'm sure a diligent beginner may work through these PRs as well.

Some comforting words: working through these patterns in a set of PRs allows you to focus on a bit at a time, with only new changes considered. Give it a try. It might turn out easier than you think.
